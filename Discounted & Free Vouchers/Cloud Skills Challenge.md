**30 days to learn it has made another return. It is very similar to the normal cloud skills challenge from Ignite or Build.**

Basically, you just go through MS Learn and after completing it, you get **50% off** voucher. It isn't 100% but everything can help, especially since it includes a lot of exams

You get 1 voucher every 6 months.

You get it withing 3 days of finishing the challenge.
