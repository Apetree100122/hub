Microsoft has changed the certification renewal process so now instead of having to take the exam every 2 years, you just have to complete renewal assessment every year.

You only renew certifications so if you for example earned Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification by passing the AZ-303 and AZ-304 you only need to do one assessment for the certification. It doesn't matter that the exams changed in the meantime as long as the certification itself isn't being retired.

There are also some people saying that for certification renewal you no longer need the prerequisite certification. So that would mean you can let your associate certifications expire and still renew your expert certification without hassle. But I would strongly discourage people from doing that since doing a free quiz is easier than passing the exam once you will need it.

Confirmed by Microsoft FAQ, you don't need to renew prerequisite associate certification to renew an expert certification.

Exams themselves don't expire which means you have as much time as you need to complete the certification.  [Proof](https://trainingsupport.microsoft.com/en-us/mcp/forum/all/is-there-any-time-limit-to-complete-the/4e885c43-bcde-44ce-a685-f4c3adf9f4dc)

Renewal assessment:

* Consists of around 40 questions (depending on the question bank you randomly get)
* It is an open book test so you can freely use the internet to help you with the answering
* Has no time limit to complete it
* After the initial 2 attempts you have to wait 24h before attempting it again
* You will get the chance to pass the assessment roughly half a year before the certification expires so you get a lot of chances and losing the certificate is only caused because you didn't want to do it
* Shows you the assessment areas and how you did in them
* Is free!
