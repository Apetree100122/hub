There are a lot of resources for Microsoft Partners but a lot of them are under NDAs so I will only put here those that are available for public. If you are unsure if your company is a partner, you can look here [Microsoft Partner Directory](http://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partner-dir/).

**Associating your certification profile with your organization**

Sign into your organizations [Partner Center Account](https://partner.microsoft.com/pc/users/myaccount) (yes, it is very slow to get there, it isn't a problem on your side) and under **Your learning** choose the **Associate Microsoft Learning account.**

If you are wondering what the Partner University is, there are some assessments that you needed to take for some competencies but since the whole system is changing, there is no need to provide more information on this topic.

[**New Microsoft Partner designations**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/introduction-to-pcs)

You can find all the related information in the linked documentation.

The biggest change from the now ending competencies is that requirements require fewer certifications from single individuals and in ~~benefits the Visual Studio Enterprise subscription will no longer have the monthly credits (it will be bulk credits for one subscription instead)~~ People got pissed about that so the change was delayed for now. Visual Studio Enterprise remains unchanged at this moment.

Also, now it will be significantly harder to obtain designations for smaller companies so if you can renew the legacy Gold/Silver, do it. Action pack and specializations will remain unchanged.

[**Microsoft demo environments**](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/)

For long term demo tenants (there are other resources but this is the most significant one), this is the best way to get them for free. The tenants are only missing license for E5 for devices (it is probably Windows 365 E5 but it isn't specified from what I have found). You can even have one for a year and create them on demand.

[**Microsoft Techcommunity for Partners**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/partner-discussion-topics/ct-p/PartnerDiscuss)

These are the communication channels, where you can see 99% of any news or changes happening to everything. I recommend subscribing to the community in your region to stay up to date on all the cool stuff
