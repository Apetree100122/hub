**Virtual Training Days are no longer offering Free exam vouchers.**

**Microsoft** [**Build**](https://aka.ms/buildcsc) **and** [**Ignite**](https://aka.ms/ignitecsc) **Cloud Skills Challenges** \- Microsoft Build usually happens in Fall and Ignite in Spring. Historically both of the events end with a Cloud Skills Challenge.

* You enter the challenge and will have the option to complete one of the predetermined learning paths. You don't actually need to read those or answer the questions correctly at the end of modules, so if you don't have much time you can skip through the content and read it during your preparation later.
* The voucher is usually valid for the next 6 months, after that you will be unable to reschedule it any further (it is the final deadline) and you can only use the voucher code for the exams that are eligible for that specific challenge event.
* In the past vouchers were universal, that has changed at Ignite 2021. You can pick any exam from the available exam list for the challenge so you can for example do SC-200 modules and take SC-300 exam.
