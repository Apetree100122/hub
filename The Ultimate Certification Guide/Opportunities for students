Microsoft offers a lot of resources to get students into the cloud, here are some opportunities that Microsoft offers.

[**Student training and certification**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/student-training-and-certification) \- All of the fundamental exams **including** MS-900 are free to prepare for and take when you verify your student status.

[**Azure for Students**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) \- Similar to the Free Azure Account but better. If you have an email address from your school, you should be eligible for this offer. You get 100$ in credits for 12 months and a bunch of free services to play with. No credit card needed, only the email address.

[**Student exam discount**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/student-discounts) \- If you pick Student as a Job title in your certification profile and verify your status, you will be eligible for discounted Microsoft exam prices. For example, in my country the discounted price for a non-fundamental exam is 61$. You can see the discount when you check out while ordering it.

[**Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors**](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/) \- If you are enrolled at university, you can apply to this program. There are a lot of benefits besides the opportunity for personal growth. For example: Azure credit, Visual Studio Enterprise subscription, certification vouchers or if you advance to the latest tier, you may be invited into the [Microsoft MVP program](https://mvp.microsoft.com/).

[**University credits for certifications**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/college-credit) \- If your university allows it, you can gain credits for your certifications. There are also credits for fundamental exams which are really easy to obtain and can be taken for free.
