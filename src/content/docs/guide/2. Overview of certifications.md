# The Certifications

You can find the complete and frequently updated certification poster at [https://aka.ms/TrainCertPoster](https://aka.ms/TrainCertPoster).

* Each rectangle contains a different certification.
* Under certification you can see the exams required to get it.
* By clicking on the certification name, you will be directed into the certification webpage.
* After clicking the exam name, you will be directed into the exam webpage.
* The star symbol in the top right indicates it is an expert level certification
* The lock symbol in the bottom right indicates there is a prerequisite certification you must hold to be able to get this certification.

I will use the [Microsoft Certified: Cybersecurity Architect Expert](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/cybersecurity-architect-expert/?WT.mc_id=certposter_poster-wwl%3FWT.mc_id%3Dcertposter_poster-wwl) as an example. As you can see on this image:

(You can find this on every certification page), you need to:

* Complete one prerequisite certification out of those on the left side.
  and
* Pass the SC-100 exam

After that will then receive the Microsoft Certified: Cybersecurity Architect Expert certification.

If you only take the SC-100 exam, you will receive the badge for SC-100 exam, but you won't achieve the certification which is what really counts.

You can see the difference here:

**To pass an exam you need 70% of the total score so your score can't be lower than 700/1000. Scoring is individual and depends on the question set you receive. If you want to get familiar with the testing process, I have thoroughly described it in this post:** [**How to take Microsoft Exams**](%20%20%20%20%20%20How%20to%20take%20Microsoft%20Exams.md).

**There are 4 certification types in total:**

* Fundamentals (1 star)
* Associate (2 star)
* Expert (3 star)
* Specialty

**Fundamentals** 

* Fundamental certifications consist of entry level exams in their respective areas. Their content is usually learning how does the respective area works, what are the major products and what their purpose is. This certification is aimed at non-technical people (sales associates, managers, executive level employees) and people trying to enter Microsoft Cloud before they go towards harder exams.
* When taking the exam, you will have 45 minutes for the exam itself + 20 minutes where you will have to read non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and go through questionnaires.

Fundamental certifications are good for life and will never expire, even when the exam/certification is retired.

**Associate** 

* Associate certifications are very technical certifications that often require hands-on experience with the technology (Hands-on isn't required but it makes studying and preparation easier). They are aimed at professionals who want to certify their skills.
* When taking the exam, you will have 100 minutes (if it can contain a lab, you get 120 minutes) + 20 minutes where you will have to read NDA and go through questionnaires.
* Associate certifications have to be renewed every year. The renewal process is described here: [**Certification Renewal**](%20%20Certification%20Renewal.md).

**Expert**

* Expert certifications are a mix of technical and architectural content and are almost impossible to pass without hands-on experience. You will be expected to know all of the relevant products, how they work, differences between similar products, SKUs and basic knowledge of how to use the products and how they work with each other. They are aimed at people who already feel really comfortable in the cloud.
* Exam time and expiry policy are the same as associate exam

**Specialty**

* Specialty certifications are purely concentrated around the product in their name. They are a mix of high level and technical knowledge and require a really good understanding of it and how it fits in with Microsoft Cloud.
* Exam time and expiry policy are the same as associate exam
