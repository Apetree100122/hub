## [Microsoft Enterprise Skills Initiative](https://esi.microsoft.com/) 
**(50% Discount Voucher)**

If your company is a huge Microsoft customer or partner, there is a high chance your company is enrolled into this program. You can check it by visiting the URL https://esi.microsoft.com and typing in your work email address. 
For those who don't have it and are interested in getting your company enrolled, unfortunately there is not much information available online. Reliable ways to get more information is to get in contact with your Microsoft representative and ask them. It is also usually part of a Enterprise Agreement.

You get access to:
- Live trainings by Microsoft Certified Trainers
- Microsoft official MeasureUp practice tests (being slowly replaced by Microsoft's new practice assessments for exams that have one)
- And 50% off vouchers for all Fundamenta, Azure and SCI exams.
